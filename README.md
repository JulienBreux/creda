# CREDA â€” Cloud Run Event-Driven Autoscaling

CREDA is a Cloud Run worker pool Event Driven Autoscaler.\
With CREDA, you can drive the scaling of any worker pool in Cloud Run based on the number of events needing to be processed.

This project is naturally mainly inspired by the awesome and useful [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) tool.
